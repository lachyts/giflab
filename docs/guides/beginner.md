#### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
```bash
# Install GifLab
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd giflab
poetry install

# Install compression engines (dual-pipeline architecture)
# Required: Production engines (gifsicle + Animately)
# On macOS:
brew install python@3.11 gifsicle
# Animately included in repository (bin/darwin/arm64/animately)

# Optional: Additional engines for experimental pipeline
brew install ffmpeg imagemagick gifski

# On Linux/Ubuntu:
sudo apt install python3.11 gifsicle
# Animately: Download from releases (see bin/linux/x86_64/PLACEHOLDER.md)
# Optional: sudo apt install ffmpeg imagemagick-6.q16; cargo install gifski

# On Windows:
choco install python gifsicle
# Animately: Download from releases (see bin/windows/x86_64/PLACEHOLDER.md)
# Optional: choco install ffmpeg imagemagick; winget install gifski
```

📖 **For detailed setup instructions, see:** [Setup Guide](setup.md)

#### Step 2: Organize Your GIFs

GifLab can automatically detect GIF sources based on directory structure, making it easy to organize and analyze GIFs from different platforms:

```bash
# Create the directory structure with automatic source detection
python -m giflab organize-directories data/raw/

# This creates organized directories:
# data/raw/tenor/          - GIFs from Tenor
# data/raw/animately/      - GIFs from Animately platform  
# data/raw/tgif_dataset/   - GIFs from TGIF research dataset
# data/raw/unknown/        - Ungrouped GIFs
```

**Two approaches for organizing:**

**Option A: Directory-based source detection (Recommended)**
```bash
# Move GIFs to appropriate directories for automatic detection
data/raw/
├── tenor/
│   ├── love/              # "love" search results
│   └── marketing/         # "marketing" search results
├── animately/             # All user uploads (flat structure)
│   ├── user_upload_1.gif
│   ├── user_upload_2.gif
│   └── user_upload_3.gif
└── tgif_dataset/          # All research data (flat structure)
    ├── research_gif_1.gif
    ├── research_gif_2.gif
    └── research_gif_3.gif
```

**Option B: Simple organization**
```bash
# Or just put all GIFs in data/raw/ for simple analysis
cp /path/to/your/gifs/*.gif data/raw/
```

📖 **For detailed organization guide, see:** [Directory-Based Source Detection Guide](directory-source-detection.md)

### Phase 2: Analysis & Planning (10-30 minutes)

#### Step 3: Explore Your Dataset
```bash
# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Open: notebooks/01_explore_dataset.ipynb
# Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook
```

**What you'll learn:**
- How many GIFs you have and their characteristics
- File size distributions and complexity patterns
- Optimal compression parameters for your collection
- Processing time estimates

#### Step 4: Generate Optimization Data
```bash
# Open: notebooks/02_build_seed_json.ipynb
# Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook
```

**What you'll get:**
- `seed/lookup_seed_metadata.json` - Metadata index
- `seed/lookup_seed_processing.json` - Optimization recommendations
- `seed/lookup_seed_resume.json` - Resume functionality data

### Phase 3: Processing (1-100+ hours)

#### Step 5: Start Compression Processing
```bash
# Basic processing (uses default settings)
python -m giflab run data/raw data/ --workers 4

# Advanced processing (uses optimization data from notebooks)
python -m giflab run data/raw data/ --workers 8 --resume --use-seed-data
```

#### Step 6: Monitor Progress
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f logs/giflab_*.log

# Check results
ls data/csv/
ls data/renders/
```

#### Step 7: Add AI Tags (Optional)
```bash
# Add AI-generated tags to your results
python -m giflab tag data/csv/results_YYYYMMDD.csv data/raw --workers 2
```

## 📊 Understanding Your Results

### CSV Output Format

Each row in your results CSV represents one compressed variant of one GIF:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `gif_sha` | Unique ID for the original GIF | `6c54c899e2b0baf7...` |
| `orig_filename` | Original file name | `my_animation.gif` |
| `engine` | Compression tool used | `imagemagick`, `ffmpeg`, `gifski`, `gifsicle`, `animately` |
| `lossy` | Compression level (0-120) | `40` |
| `frame_keep_ratio` | Fraction of frames kept | `0.80` |
| `color_keep_count` | Number of colors in palette | `128` |
| `kilobytes` | Size of compressed file | `245.3` |
| `ssim` | Quality score (0-1, higher=better) | `0.936` |
| `efficiency` | Overall efficiency score (0-1, higher=better) | `0.785` |
| `render_ms` | Time to compress (milliseconds) | `1250` |

### Quality Metrics Explained

**SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**
- Measures how similar the compressed GIF looks to the original
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (1.0 = identical, 0.0 = completely different)
- Good values: >0.8 (>0.9 for high quality needs)

**Efficiency Score** 🎯
- **Single balanced metric** combining quality and compression (50/50 weighting)
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher = better balance of quality and file size reduction)
- **0.8-1.0**: Excellent (production-ready)
- **0.7-0.8**: Very good (great for most uses) 
- **0.6-0.7**: Good (acceptable balance)
- **0.5-0.6**: Fair (room for improvement)
- **<0.5**: Poor (investigate issues)

**Compression Ratio**
- Calculate as: `orig_kilobytes / kilobytes`
- Higher = more compression
- Example: 1000KB → 250KB = 4x compression

### Engine Selection Guide

**Which engine should you use?**

| Engine | Best For | Speed | Quality | When to Use |
|--------|----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **gifsicle** | Simple graphics, text | ⚡⚡⚡ Fastest | ⭐⭐ Good | Quick processing, broad compatibility |
| **Animately** | Photos, gradients | ⚡⚡ Fast | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | Complex images, photo-realistic content |
| **ImageMagick** | General purpose | ⚡⚡ Fast | ⭐⭐ Good | Versatile, when other engines aren't available |
| **FFmpeg** | Video-like content | ⚡ Moderate | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | High quality, frame rate changes |
| **gifski** | Maximum quality | ⚡ Slow | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Best | When quality is paramount, small files needed |

**Quick recommendations:**
- **Production work**: Use `python -m giflab run` (gifsicle + Animately, proven reliability)
- **Engine comparison**: Use `python -m giflab run --matrix` (tests all 5 engines)
- **Photo-like GIFs**: Experimental pipeline will test gifski and Animately automatically
- **Best quality**: Experimental pipeline includes gifski (highest quality compression)
- **Large datasets**: Production pipeline optimized for scale and stability

### Finding the Best Settings

**For best overall efficiency (recommended):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM results 
ORDER BY efficiency DESC 
LIMIT 10
```

**For best efficiency per GIF:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM results 
WHERE efficiency = (SELECT MAX(efficiency) FROM results WHERE gif_sha = 'your_gif_sha')
```

**For maximum compression:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM results 
WHERE kilobytes = (SELECT MIN(kilobytes) FROM results WHERE gif_sha = 'your_gif_sha')
```

**For best quality/size balance (manual approach):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM results 
WHERE ssim > 0.9 
ORDER BY kilobytes ASC 
LIMIT 10
```

**For fastest processing:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM results 
WHERE engine = 'gifsicle'
ORDER BY render_ms ASC 
LIMIT 10
```

**Compare engines for your content:**
```sql
SELECT engine, AVG(ssim) as avg_quality, AVG(kilobytes) as avg_size, AVG(render_ms) as avg_time
FROM results 
GROUP BY engine
ORDER BY avg_quality DESC
```
